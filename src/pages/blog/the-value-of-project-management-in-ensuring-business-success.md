Over the last few years, the project manager role has become more popular in many organizations. Project management holds projects together, ensuring they meet objectives on time, within budget, and at the expected quality level, which helps ensure business success.

According to the Project Management Institute (PMI), organizations that fail to integrate project management into their strategies experience a project failure rate more than 60 percent higher than those that do. Failed projects can derail key initiatives and stall business growth.

The PMI defines project management as the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to meet project requirements. The project lifecycle includes initiation, planning, execution, and closure. Many projects are naturally complex, involving multiple stakeholders, which makes a project manager essential for guiding efforts and keeping the team focused on success.

In the planning stage, project management helps organizations establish realistic goals, budgets, and timelines. This reduces the likelihood of underestimating costs or overestimating delivery speed. A project manager gathers input from stakeholders to understand strategic priorities and objectives. Based on this information, they develop a plan that balances these priorities within time and budget constraints. The process also includes cost estimation, resource allocation, and risk management.

Project management clarifies objectives and priorities, preventing scope creep and keeping projects aligned with business strategies. This alignment ensures that initiatives contribute meaningfully to organizational goals and support overall growth.

Lastly, project management enables the right people to perform the right tasks at the right time. Without a set project management method, many teams tend to work reactively, instead of proactively planning for known risks and setting project goals and parameters from the outset.
